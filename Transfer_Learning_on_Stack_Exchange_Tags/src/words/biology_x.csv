several problems I I find answer despite much If great anyone answer supposedly fatal problems Biological since I find troubling appears answer first one called mutation protection Simply Evolution evolved mechanisms protect left build wreck biological yet mutation repair protection mechanisms guard stop changes allow Evolution answer problem genetic John Sanford supposedly shown book Genetic Entropy mystery human genome degrading evolved ape like creatures millions problem supposedly mutations either This supposed mean new mutations accumulate every every single Then said mutations small gotten rid natural vast majority harmful human mutations left build people entire human race becomes estimated occurred less So Evolution talk person presenting problem gave answers two He gave response Evolutionist retort mutations harmful neutral saying mutations neutral perspective physical fitness mutations must effect genetic content In way mutations truly neutral must effect even affect efficiency transferRNA And as pointed gave response Evolutionist retort unselectable mutations will occur regions DNA Junk therefore individual will die population will become saying DNA code proteins scientists previously thought largely But mutations DNA make without effect since DNA helps embryonic development part many The idea DNA absorbs thereby making false merely argument answer called How goes two types Primary DNA tells proteins tells cell maintain primary So said primary DNA completely dependent one If become unrelated become unusable animal problem mutations thus completely independent means primary DNA evolve completely random independent events thus able stay relevant related one creates barrier stopping microbes man evolution taking person claims calculations show 1 chance 10 150 species previous calculation says as generous as possible five Evolution must occur net gain new completely We will simply assume beneficial mutations produce evolutionary change called become beneficial later The rate beneficial mutations widely thought 1 every million scientists observed millions harmful mutations beneficial But will assume frequency occurrence 1 beneficial mutation per It will assumed mutations needed make species another species two species Although number needed new species arise probably higher animals require millions beneficial mutations accounted million mutational differences exist chimpanzees though different We will assume total amount species lived past 10 In upper end estimate species living If species become extinct as many Darwinists assumption extremely It will assumed every single beneficial mutation fixed population This unrealistic favour Beneficial mutations lost population variety sexual

transcription factors Others involved important RNA including ribosome mRNA transcription Motif discovery active area research novo computational perhaps given set DNA algorithm used candidate shared This thought as task set approximately matching substrings given starting set This difficult general DNA sequence analysis often using DNA sequence It reasonable ask question makes sequence From biological motif simply smallest identifiable sequence component This subcomponent thought as identifiable piece functionality related underlying sequence analysis often focuses identifying motifs typically analyzing set DNA sequences biological significance solely motifs contained within potentially discards possible correlelations nucleotide positions Note also methods used identify motifs typically like Markov Models naturally tailored towards looking small possibly complementary consider sequence as single try direct statistical This approach less often One reason sequences quickly

specifically looking genetic reasons Doubling concentration extracellular calcium hyperpolarizes back envelope calculations try answer question mathematical Essentially question Why increasing extracellular potassium concentration depolarize increasing extracellular calcium concentration hyperpolarize initial thought change equilibrium potential Working however I realized I wrong math proved concentration extracellular potassium makes equilibrium potential potassium mV For increases driving force mV room 300 K What means will cause resting potential neuron become slightly though calcium less indeed adding positive ions outside cell increases driving force assuming conductance will depolarization makes think phenomena explained neuron Some mechanism responsible increased extracellular calcium causing neuron possible calcium concentration driving force calcium influx calcium thus internal calcium concentration will Because concentration calcium ions inside previously near now internal concentration will rise significant thereby hyperpolarizing internal concentration calcium rises instead perhaps conjunction lowering resting potential activation potassium thus raising conductance potassium thus ultimately hyperpolarizing I right track I missing Is Mutation Theory still complex afraid like people I suffer learned History rather cutting chase learning actual

genetic mutation species making impossible species genetic mutation completely see new weak species dying use polar bear example If bear brown black fur trial evolved bear white fur survive better arctic also short amount time bears fur colors match colors environment as orange purple And apply species like elephants tiny ears squirrels four How come I never see need lot genetic mutations create healthy understand one genetic mutation unlikely species fur color I find hard believe entire physical structure able reshape something just as healthy healthy one completely random genetic As I know I open compiled program start adding random symbols program will rarely even start nearly impossible chance change make program Same goes DNA just useless lumps probably noticed everything body sort You never find random lump arm tongue And I know random lumps evolutionary And evolutionary advantage random neither evolutionary All people lumps arm die equal chance surviving as people without lumps arm just as many come species always attracted genetic say short Then evolves gets longer How come longer beak birds now attracted longer beak If change species come now think differently still believe I just find current explanation little questionable I think scientists may simplifying If answers questions please leave everyone made way I know kind long How many sensory neurons human I understand wide disparity precision comes specifying constitutes trying find authoritative source provide least rough order magnitude estimate number receptors human peripheral nervous system also mechanoreceptors proprioceptors as The sources I found far provide hints I found estimates as high as as low as none guesses cite authoritative sure I student anatomy interests lie cognitive science artificial neural forgive question But put I want know roughly many sensory signals human brain capacity I looking precise hoping least reduce uncertainty less four orders My purpose investigation try quantify magnitude computational capability brain regard external If one imagine nervous distinct artificial neural many input sensors need able simultaneously process par human I recognize comments inherent ambiguity let attempt Assuming number incoming signals brain one time limited number neural connections brain stem spinal someone provide indication number might assumption overly feel free enlighten Sugars Carbohydrates right sugars carbohydrates carbohydrates carbohydrates sugars sugars I answer say carbohydrates three fiber deduce carbohydrates During phases blood pressure maximum Holosystole came across sure Some medical students told systole others told holosystole standing complete length I need clarity regards becoming really Growth rate as indicator fitness fish Ecology Evolution like calculate selection gradients order gain insight strength type selection influencing study I like I need indication question make sense use growth rates per year as advance What kinds light attract moths know kinds lights attract moths filament Does Requirement energy metabolic processes someone explain following reaction occur without net influx energy 6 one need influx Clonality

class quick I distinguish terpenoids compounds example artemisinin image present continuous carbon chain alternated polycyclic structure as terpenoid main criterion I consider image description Where I find standard tissue cell developing specialized database desease microarray The initial data retreived NCBI ArrayExpress The problem sample attributes sometimes specify similar things different as cell tissue desease ethnicity Where I find conventions naming experiment sample How calculate protein energy PDB file like measure energy without energy already TINKER software Does anyone know NAMD Stem cell organ growing genitals reading lot stem cell research work growing artificial sufficient advance theoretical reason possible grow genital organs question theoretical reason use process grow genital organs opposite sex stem cell ovary grown male stem cells potentially ovulate Summary statistic distinguish migration pop2 pop1 pop1 pop2 two sister populations diverged time say pop2 migrates pop1 breeds giving offspring sequence segments similar pop1 There stats find similar two populations mean dxy takes average number pairwise sequence differences two sister Say mean dxy locus length 10000 Then say mean dxy locus Detecting dxy unlikely null hypothesis migration indicates migration interbreeding thinking summary statistics distinguish migration pop2 pop1 migration pop1 pop2 one events Do statistics Without loss generality assume pop2 members migrate Then pop1 will members similar pop2 compared migration pop2 will as migration run simulations population expect see value pi segregating These measurements may different pop1 pop2 migrates members pop1 will SNPs pop2 thus genetic variation pi pop1 compared expected pi ss So dxy say similarity pop1 pop2 expected null pi ss say two higher genetic variation Can statistic depends dxy pi distinguish migration pop1 pop2 vs migration pop2 What state biceps I flexed starting flex myosin actin slide ratchet like When totally
