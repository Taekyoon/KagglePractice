Alice stores file wants share The way Alice decrypt file locally reencrypt public key send This cumbersome means sharing takes time needs Alice able send new encrypted way design system without

Can get two unpredictable hashes message like create database questions answers attacker access database obtain either questions secure looking answer question might proceed as XOR value done securely hash function as looked used combine message additional The additional strings Would access one MAC weaken The answer size as answer question asked application The database publicly anyone store

hello messages act P Prime G Secret primes owned need random number along secret generate master secret as DH requires q generated Machine Learning Encryption Learning sometimes associated Many cross field studies majorly done use machine learning I interested knowing machine learning used anyway Googling give relevant Are references resources Or idea impractical without much future Can I use asymmetric encryption powerful game I developing uses internal It matter whether user read file means I need symmetric I want possible user alter without completely breaking game make cheating

file application The log system following file format files left open application still data appended as log entry entries varying I align cipher block application must read existing log understand contents decide whether append new items file start new This requires symmetric encryption key must embedded application receiver log file must know So I guess static least decrypted data must longer original log viewer will try make another complete log item additional allow use encryption I Somebody extract static key application algorithm able read log But log file encrypted may contain information reveal internal names obfuscated encoded Reading log file help used AES CBC mode encrypt configuration files static application password generates IV key through Rfc2898DeriveBytes something like Together random salt prepended But files always read written one It handles padding well yet sure entirely unclear I append padded encrypted file later Could I just seek last block overwrite using somebody knows I read stream ciphers process one byte I think I stop writing point continue point But seem generally insecure point useless encrypt data I enclose file stream instance I know whether I get sequential read write access encrypted file I need read existing file continue Does work encrypted files I handle encrypting log Are certain algorithms modes ways good I just XOR log file static like used as kids call reply files appended eventually deleted entries NUL An int32 value takes exactly 4 single log entry technically limited 256 rarely ever nearly as file format spec encryption basically string entries need numbers structure even think solution log viewer log files as But data last complete log must valid complete log If reader will wait become flush single byte file log item appear last byte Random noise end file will break live reading mode especially interesting considering While writing stream must buffer data least one block If I close stream block padding If I want flush stream keep padding probably breaks I found I either read file write And I seek So appending existing file probably option maybe I need possible block ciphers block find

created thread Reddit give several none seems I see 3 options user gave encryption Not secure password used encrypt encryption key Pretty secure private encryption key Very going use since key will stored I hash encryption But hash must stored And hashed encryption key going used decrypt user I use 16 chars It user friendly user needs set remember 16 char So guess NOT I store I going decrypt suggest Is possible deduce value string given hash multiples hashes string known I access as many as I Every string Can I use extra information advantage try deduce without requiring Or still bruteforce try less combinations since Attacks Full TripleDES reading attacks many work specific rounds TripleDES full Is attack except brute force works full Is TripleDES 168bit vulnerable

In paper page Bernstein asks alike question stream independent argues But merely argues authentication part things nothing really help trying learn potential benefits construction might besides debated authentication Is safe seed random number generator system seemed Bouncy Castle class uses as seed unsafe Are HMACs based hashes larger also I choose use questions tagged as For I use hash like using as keyed create increase security choosing hash larger Is HMAC based weaker really matter cryptographically Importance salt deriving encryption key curious know bit confuses I two files

Could Eve capture public derive different private key correspond impersonate Bob saying public Even though Eve private able produce private key compatible public Turning PRPs PRGs counter following

single keys implementing instead I enter guessing breaks three What process breaking Rate stronger came simple idea I know really secure I know create algorithm just Alice Bob agree common secret say P1 done using secure like meeting real life just single time exchange password practical exchanging one time chooses one secret say keeps Bob hashes password Bob hashed hashed sends hashed password even insecure Bob sends hash say Alice wants encrypt She P1 common hash HP1 hashed password message using long password concatenated gets two different private password common shared algorithm transforms two words hashes tries decrypt great Alice encrypts message hashed even someone knows shared Bob decrypt someone finds private still anything know common Alice knows common sure cypher

sends B sends A sends B nonce nonce spoofing take place someone pretends Amy even without knowing shared Security equivalent security proof one as known Is problem computing equivalent Diffie In easy compute feeling similar harder problem original given compute But I come reasonable Could please Allowing multiple password reset question random number predictability requirements password reset along questions end as aim provide password reset mechanism satisfying following tokens per allow email delays cause access database reset information easily reset replay timing insecure random number See secret random value known outside password reset token used user reset available tokens user deleted The approach given modified version authentication modification now multiple fixed secret picked ahead construct reset token user generate random number consider picked incrementing counter salt let key HMAC id reset expiration sending someone tries reset give us values find previously stored corresponds nothing If token previous value id two values match note token valid allow user reset When stored reset information entries given first requirements obvious met The main one worth explaining someone access database reset information easily reset token value stored corresponding someone read database construct valid reset password equality checking user tampers values will generate radically different value avoid exposing timing inclusion make generation HMAC value since token similar properties predictable random random number generator ever produces number attacker easy enough find correct ID thus get valid reset least as number generators rely paranoid system question involves various pieces personal get around issue predictable random try sending HMAC value user verify incrementing ID counter value random send handling reset take value verify neither tampered checking equal verification step use find continue as random number thus ever predicted know generate valid since requires secret pair never seen ever use look database ever expose timing attack actually secure timing replay This feels borderline Are vastly simpler security properties reduced allowing attacker generate arbitrary number reset since allowing multiple tokens exist anyone send unreasonable try defend ostensibly secure random number hypothetical future reworded scheme secure

ask Server Client encrypt predict though plaintext I see attack SSH To perform attack format data put format Padding Data CRC attack performed partially taking advantage CBC encryption changing first block 8 byte padding order manipulate second 8 byte If I perform attack though examined protocol since 4 byte CRC split first second protocol question protocol weaker compared protocol proper MAC like HMAC used attack relatively easily break The terminology quite CRC32 used as weak substitute keyless transformation used as weak substitute hash AES multiple devices server communication multiple devices connecting whose communication needs At moment I AES library job I using database keys corresponds keys stored devices per message device server preceded unencrypted ID identifying message as

Eve distinguish random Eve public keys Alice make easier distinguish random Eve public way deduce message came Alice destined computation load storage image description passage said computational load attack reduced approximately storage data sets I figure time complexity data sets somebody Large file validation embedded system through hash encryption I say I noob Having said I will ask situation I need validate protect tampering handful large binary files distributed embedded system Android These original files will need hash ensure files tampered challenge files updated patch periodically downloaded These patch files will also distributed hash will ensure patch files will downloaded secure patch needs applied original files embedded system will result need regenerate hash newly patched files subsequently verified several large files running embedded algorithms hashing like SHA256 may prove expensive compute runtime embedded The back napkin calculation says may take upwards several minutes Since verification must occur every time application launched read must fast 10GBs data less 5 patch applied embedded actual hash newly patched file must computed embedded system thinking simply compute hash large files Then I make server request mutual encrypt MD5 hash private key encrypted hash embedded Then whenever I want verify file I use public key decrypt encrypted hash verify

symmetric Practical benefit using see KDFs used systems rely practical benefit suppose system relies shared secret AES encryption If uses key derived attacker still sniff key decrypt key regenerated using purpose remain fixed unless compromise scenarios KDF increase Is just increase entropy key harder How AES cycle walking used as bit confused reading several articles seem provide conflicting Basically I wondering AES used as And something computationally something reasonable Furthermore use AES cycle says one methods FPE Cycle walking Method cycle walking works encrypting plaintext repeatedly applying AES 3DES cipher text becomes acceptable The duration general construct set AES mode paper also table summarizes speed method compared image description another stated prohibitively expensive use cyclewalking alone since take many iterations get value desired just use Because works block size approximately size valid lot smaller block size lot iterations order get use block cipher order encrypt SSN end prohibitive number need use construct block cipher approximately right use shave last sure result 1500 milliseconds comparison table considered prohibitive encryption Is succinct verification arbitrary data transformation theoretically Is input string transformation computer possible provide succinct proof another binary string identical output I basically mean

organistation like hash large file paths asssign specific To prevent hash I thought use sort technique as use prevent rainbow tables password When hash value will first prepend will used as hmac secret verify good way prevent Can modified executable file padded give SHA1 checksums seem gold standard comes making sure file tampered modified file padded data give finding correct padding similar computational cost as mining bitcoin finding padding generates checksum matches first last ten digits sufficient mislead large part users just eyeball identity Definitions secrecy found terms like forward I like know definitions understand differences among found several confusing definitions especially mixing meanings forward secrecy perfect forward meanings forward backwards What reading Security Whitepaper I found term What mean Message Key derived Chain Key forward every message new agreement performed message roundtrip create Chain This provides forward secrecy through immediate round trip Encrypting 256 bit AES keys AES using AES ECB mode encrypt encryption keys encryption keys Aware significant weaknesses come encrypting data greater block size also aware AES Key wrapping functions The low efficiency AES KW high throughput cases issue case fields encrypted data encryption high entropy RNG 4 PRNG sources bits long even longer avoiding etc skip IV reduce size since every byte precious
