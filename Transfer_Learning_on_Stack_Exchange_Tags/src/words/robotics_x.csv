question extension previous problem association My problem line 16 aforementioned I compute getting huge number This probability density Why pdf getting bigger 1 huge Path comparison cartesian position end effector robot arm every millisecond time steps The robot arm commanded path different So I get different I want calculate deviation distances equivalent points two The problem find

find appropriate constant power setting overcome gravity pendulum hold arbitrary With worm need apply constant power motor desired position Power motor cut worm gear will resist force backdrive pendulum lowest gravity seems integrator PID algorithm will cause large overshoots desired position I want integrator initially help control pendulum desired But position need integrator turn solution I come test special condition PID algorithm checks position reached AND angular speed instantaneously reset integrator Is better way handle integrator system resists EDIT I originally worded I mostly

build control software entirely written Motor control seems important true typical brushless DC motor ESC Speed approximately control ESC seems approximate idea fast motor This still works PID Integral controller gets indirect feedback say gyroscope whether motor going fast enough tell ESC make revolve good understanding paragraph I wonder whether servo motor inform current rate rotation help away ESC I feel microcontroller receive input motor speeds send output requesting certain need But I sure servo motors work happens immediately request 100rpm say adjust microcontroller immediately adjust motors account fact motors 100rpm Does imply microcontroller request small deltas currently measured period deviation desired state latter requesting small deltas currently measured algorithm seems like really PID since way control But may requesting servo go 80rpm 100rpm causes reach 81rpm much faster requesting go 80rpm feel I know little I put finger I hope gives idea concepts I struggling questions servo motor allow away servo motor accept control inputs as servo motor offer output saying 80rpm servo motor 80rpm go 81rpm faster requested revolve 100rpm versus less precise

I need take consideration thinking Up force servo motor reasonable choice as working application I need apply linear angular force operate linkage I know amount force I will I anticipate will less kg The travel distance linkage input less 15 I look through available seem exist firmly realm remote control as I uncertain will suitable For one digital torque listed 20 I means 1 cm center servo I expect approximately 20 kg If I wanted 15 cm travel distance I need roughly cm diminish applied force 20 well might understanding calculation even remotely Should I looking types actuators instead They seem become prohibitively expensive 20 purposes budget actuator less like reasonable control intermediate positions across travel good holding fairly fast For reason I dismissed idea using linear actuator driven gearmotor worm relatively new robotics usage motorized used pneumatic cylinders many For I use additional constraints The linkage one part portable system scissor lift It theatrical effect motion amplified force reduced ratio mechanical advantage It will carried As actuation needs as tubing wiring tether Tubing wiring Because portable will The control system will designed
